## 🔐 Ruleset Enforcement

This repository uses a custom ruleset to block insecure code patterns and enforce best practices.

- All contributors must comply with the ruleset.
- Repository admins may bypass rules in exceptional cases (e.g., emergency fixes, false positives).

Bypasses should be documented in the pull request to ensure transparency.
