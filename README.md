# Simulating Anxiety in an AI  
*A reinforcement learning experiment in emotional realism*
This project simulates an AI agent navigating a high-pressure environment where stress is punished and panic ends the episode. It's a critique of how real-world systems treat neurodivergent behavior — not with empathy, but with termination logic.
> "If you're scared, I'm going to make it **worse**."  
>This simulation encodes the cruel logic of systems that punish vulnerability. The agent is rewarded for composure, punished for stress, and terminated for panic — just like many humans navigating institutions that don't accommodate emotional complexity.
This project is open-source because emotional realism should be accessible.


this project uses a custom gymnasium environment that was built from the ground up for the task that it does.
